    <br>The game we created is a very universal game of Tic Tac Toe but with a Minions theme. You will either be using an O or an X against one of your friends. Click on the square you want to place your shape.  Be competitive and have fun! We met the requirements by creating loops for the X's/O'S and animated the drawing board.

    <br>The game we created is a NASCAR game where you will use the arrow keys to move the car around the track in 30 seconds as fast as you can. Try your best and have fun! We met the requirements by having a timer and a car that moves around the track.
